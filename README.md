Amazon Sales Data Analysis (EDA Project)

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze Amazon sales data to understand:
Revenue & profit distribution
Top-selling products
Regional performance
Sales trends & patterns
Product category behaviour
Order priority impact on revenue
The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, outlier detection, and feature engineering using Python. The insights help in improving sales strategy, inventory planning, and business profitability.

## Problem Statement

Amazon generates a massive volume of sales data across products, categories, and regions. However:
It is difficult to identify top-performing products/regions.
Sales trends need to be understood for better inventory planning.
Raw and unorganized data must be cleaned for meaningful insights.
The goal is to analyze, visualize, and summarize the data to uncover hidden trends and actionable insights.

## Dataset Information

Rows: 100
Columns: 14

No missing values
No duplicate entries
Outliers were found in numeric columns like Units Sold, Unit Price, Total Revenue, and Total Profit.

## Conclusion

This EDA project provides meaningful insights into Amazon’s sales behavior. Using data visualization, correlation analysis, anomaly detection, and feature engineering, the analysis highlights:
Revenue-driving regions and products
Seasonal trends and price distributions
Product categories with high or low profitability
Actionable insights that support inventory planning, marketing strategy, and forecasting
